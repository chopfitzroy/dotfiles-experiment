# WezTerm ðŸ§¶

[WezTerm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/) has a number of features that make it particularily appealing, some of the primary reasons are:

- It works well with WSL 2.
- It works on macOS, Linux and Windows.
- It has fallback font support which allows me to use any font I like with [nerd fonts symbols](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/faq/#kitty-is-not-able-to-use-my-favorite-font).
- It has a built in multiplexer which prevents some [historic issues](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/391#issuecomment-638320745) associated with using multiplexers.

Special mention to [Zellij](https://zellij.dev/) which I would be using as a multiplexer if WezTerm did not package it's own.
