# Zsh üêö

The primary reason for using Zsh over something like [Fish](https://fishshell.com/) is that Zsh is Bash compatiable, meaning it _just works_ with a lot of tools I already use.
 
[Sheldon](https://sheldon.cli.rs/) plugin manager keeps the plugin config _outside_ of the `.zshrc`, this creates a clear separation between what is my config and what is plugins.

[Starship](https://starship.rs/) keeps the prompt config outside of the `.zshrc`, additionally it supports a number of different shells meaning if I ever switch shells I can likely bring this with me.
